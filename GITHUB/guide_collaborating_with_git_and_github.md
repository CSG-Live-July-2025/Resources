### **Introduction**

**What is Git?**

Git is a version control system that lets you save snapshots of your code over time. It's like an "undo" button for your projects.

**What is GitHub?**

GitHub is a website that hosts Git repositories online, allowing you to share your code with others and collaborate on projects.

**What is a Pull Request?**

A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a codebase. It's like asking the project maintainers, "Can you pull these changes into your project?"

### **Prerequisites**

- Git installed on your computer.
- A GitHub account.
- A project repository on GitHub.

### **Step 1: Set Up Your Local Repository**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   - Open your terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want your project to live.
   - Run:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
     ```

   - Replace `your-username` and `your-repository` with your GitHub username and repository name.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

### **Step 2: Update the Main Branch**

1. **Switch to the Main Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Pull the Latest Changes**

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

   - This ensures your local copy is up-to-date with the remote repository.

### **Step 3: Create a Feature Branch**

**Why Use Branches?**

Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

1. **Create and Switch to a New Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

   - Replace `your-feature-name` with a brief description (e.g., `feature/login-page`).

### **Step 4: Make Your Changes**

1. **Write Your Code**

   - Open your project in your code editor.
   - Implement the feature or fix you're working on.

2. **Test Your Code**

   - Run your application to ensure everything works.

### **Step 5: Stage and Commit Your Changes**

1. **Stage Your Changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit Your Changes**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add login page"
   ```

   - Write clear and descriptive commit messages.

### **Step 6: Push Your Branch to GitHub**

1. **Push to Remote**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### **Step 7: Create a Pull Request on GitHub**

1. **Go to Your Repository**

   - Visit `https://github.com/your-username/your-repository`.

2. **Open the Pull Request**

   - GitHub may prompt you with a **"Compare & pull request"** button after pushing a new branch.
   - If not, click on the **"Pull requests"** tab and then **"New pull request"**.

3. **Fill Out the Pull Request Details**

   - **Title**: Summarize your changes (e.g., "Add login page feature").
   - **Description**: Provide more details about what you've done and why.
   - You can also request specific people to review your PR.

4. **Create the Pull Request**

   - Click **"Create pull request"**.

### **Step 8: Collaborate and Make Changes**

1. **Review Feedback**

   - Team members can review your code and leave comments.
   - Engage in discussions if there are questions or suggestions.

2. **Make Updates if Needed**

   - If changes are requested:
     - Make the edits in your local branch.
     - Commit and push the changes:

       ```bash
       git add .
       git commit -m "Address review comments"
       git push origin feature/your-feature-name
       ```

   - The pull request will automatically update with your new commits.

### **Step 9: Merge the Pull Request**

1. **After Approval**

   - Once your PR is approved, you can merge it.
   - Click **"Merge pull request"** on GitHub.
   - Confirm the merge.

2. **Delete the Branch**

   - After merging, delete the feature branch on GitHub by clicking **"Delete branch"**.

### **Step 10: Update Your Local Main Branch**

1. **Switch to Main**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Pull the Latest Changes**

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Delete Your Local Feature Branch**

   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### **Conclusion**

You've successfully collaborated using Git and GitHub! This workflow helps keep the main codebase stable while allowing multiple developers to work on different features.
