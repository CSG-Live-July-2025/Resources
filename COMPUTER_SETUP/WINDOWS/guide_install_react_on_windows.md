### **Installing Node.js and React.js on Windows Using WSL**

**Prerequisites:**

- WSL and Ubuntu installed on your Windows machine.
- Internet access.

### **Step 1: Install Node.js and npm Using WSL**

1. **Open Windows Terminal in WSL:**
   - Open your Windows Terminal terminal by searching for **Windows Terminal** in the Start Menu and then type `wsl` in **Command Prompt** or **Windows PowerShell**.

2. **Update Ubuntu's package list:**
   - Before installing Node.js, ensure your system is up-to-date:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade
     ```

3. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   - Install the latest **LTS** version of Node.js along with **npm** (Node Package Manager) using the NodeSource repository:
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
     sudo apt install -y nodejs
     ```

4. **Verify Node.js and npm Installation:**
   - Run the following commands to check if Node.js and npm were installed successfully:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
   - You should see version numbers for both Node.js and npm.

### **Step 2: Create a New React Application Using WSL**

1. **Navigate to your projects directory (optional):**
   - If you prefer to organize your React apps in a specific folder, you can create and navigate to your project directory:
     ```bash
     mkdir ~/projects
     cd ~/projects
     ```

2. **Create a new React app using Create React App:**
   - Use `npx` (which comes with npm) to create a new React application:
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app my-app
     ```

3. **Navigate into your new app's directory:**
   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   - Start the React development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

5. **Access your React application:**
   - Your React app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your React app in action.

### **Additional Notes:**

- **Using WSL for Node.js and React.js:** By using WSL, you have access to a Linux-like environment on your Windows machine, which is especially beneficial for development workflows that require Unix-based tools.
- **No Need for Windows Node.js Installer:** Since we're using Ubuntu in WSL, there's no need to use the Node.js Windows installer. Instead, everything runs in the WSL environment.

**Node.js and React.js are now installed and running on your Windows computer using WSL!**
